# Tic_tac_toe-functionbased
A random project from class, where we took crack at basic tic tac toe in C using fuctions

Made in Codeblocks 20.03 on Windows 10.
Beware the #include<conio.h> extension for getch doesn't run on linux, but I think there is an alternative library. 
Also I got scolded for global variable, but I will leave it here as it is more practical in this case. 

May later upload a version against a computer using either random or if - defining every strategy...will thing about that.

Enjoy :)
